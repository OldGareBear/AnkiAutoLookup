# AnkiAutoLookup

Anki_auto_lookup scrapes Google Translate. Whether you type in an English or Chinese word, it will find the definition, pinyin, and a recording of the Chinese word being spoken. Anki_auto_lookup stores all this information in a CSV text database for portability before creating a text file that can be uploaded to your Anki decks. The Anki deck's notes will have the English word on one side and the Chinese characters, pinyin, and recording on the other.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'anki_auto_lookup'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install anki_auto_lookup

## Usage

Anki_auto_lookup is fairly self-explanatory.
